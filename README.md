## Special Thanks
1. Fist of all i wanna thank my wife, for always belive in my business' idea, and never let me give up.
2. I wanna thank to my wife and brother to work with me, almost for free. In the business' begining
3. Wanna thank to one special old boss and friend of mine that advised me to open a place instead of working in homeoffice

### Minor Thanks
1. Want to thank my pediatrician, that prescribed me, The Book of Virtues for Children and one computer, when I was 11. He inflamed the love to computing, that burns inside of me, and make me wake up every day to work, and learn more and more.
2. Want to Thank to every one of those that didn't believe in me, or my dreams, that i never would be here planning my own business
3. Want to thank all old bosses, excluding that special one, with them i learned what and how to do or not to do.
4. The last one, I wanna give a special thanks to a boss, working for him I learned how not to deal with my future employees, and with him I confirmed what my grandpa always said: ___Some people are so poor, but so poor, that only have money___.
